// DictionaryADT.cpp

In this file, Record processing structure has been defined which was later implemented
by Binary Search Tree data structure.

// BinarySearchTree.cpp

In this file, using list nodes, binary search tree has been implemented. 
In a binary search tree, all the key values of the left subtree of a node are smaller than the key
of that node. On the contrary, all the key values of the right subtree of a node are greater than or 
equal to the key value of the node.

// BSTNode.cpp

 In this file, the list nodes' structure has been defined. Each node has its key value, data value, pointer 
to right subtree and pointer to left subtree.
